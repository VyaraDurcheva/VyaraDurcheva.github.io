            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent
                Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's
                unbridled womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less
                tolerance by others.</p>
            <p>A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry her if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior
                government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of
                the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision. Although Vronsky and Anna
                go to Italy, where they can be together, they have trouble making friends. Back in Russia, she is
                shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life. Despite Vronsky's
                reassurances, she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity, fearing loss
                of control. </p>
            <p>A parallel story within the novel is that of Konstantin Lëvin or Ljovin, a wealthy country landowner who
                wants to marry Princess Kitty, sister to Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna's brother Oblonsky. Konstantin
                has to propose twice before Kitty accepts. The novel details Konstantin's difficulties managing his
                estate, his eventual marriage, and his struggle to accept the Christian faith, until the birth of his
                first child. </p>
            <p> The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of
                these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not
                only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families,
                religion, morality, gender and social class.</p>

        <h3>About the author</h3>

        <p>Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna
            Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his
            twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852–1856), and Sevastopol
            Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short
            stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Family Happiness, and Hadji Murad. He also
            wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays.</p>
        <p>In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally
            profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession. His literal interpretation
            of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent
            Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The
            Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as
            Mohandas Gandhi,[2] Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Bevel.[3] Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of
            Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly
            Resurrection.</p>
