                    Nelson DeMille hits USA TODAY's No. 1 with 'The Cuban Affair'

                    <p>
                        Here’s a look at what’s new on USA TODAY’s Best-Selling Books list…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ‘<b>Mac’ attack:</b> A newsy setting (Cuba) and a brand-new hero make a winning combination for Nelson DeMille, whose new novel The Cuban Affair (Simon & Schuster) makes its debut at No. 1 this week.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s DeMille’s second No. 1 debut; Radiant Angel, which featured recurring character Detective John Corey, landed in the top spot on June 4, 2015.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Cuban Affair is DeMille’s 20th novel; 13 of his books, including Plum Island, The Lion and The Panther, have made USA TODAY’s top 10. (USA TODAY’s list began in fall 1993.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In The Cuban Affair, Daniel “Mac” MacCormick, 35, a decorated Army officer who served in Afghanistan, is now a charter boat captain based in Key West. He’s drawn into a scheme to recover $60 million hidden away in Cuba.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Library Journal called The Cuban Affair a “timely, stay-up-all-night, nail-biting page-turner” and Publishers Weekly said the novel is an “action-packed, relentlessly paced thriller.”

                        Most blogs are focused on one issue. Whether you want to create a blog dedicated to your passion, or you simply want to improve your current blog, the information in this article will help you. Read on to find out how you can join the hordes of already successful online bloggers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Take any ideas as you get them for blogging. Make sure to create a place where they can be stored. Writing just when inspired can be unproductive to your blog. Many times, the best ideas can appear when you’re not able to blog. So give them a place to grow and flourish.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When running a blog, make sure that you ask open-ended questions. One of the most effective methods of getting people to respond to your posts is simply asking for it. Let your readers answer your questions by inviting them to respond with a comment. This makes them feel more engaged, which increases the odds that they’ll stick with you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you want to be a good writer, it is important that you are a good reader. Take the time to actually read what you write about, and enjoy it. When you can read it from a visitor’s point of view, you will be able to get a better understanding of any changes that you need to make to your writing style.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Providing an RSS-to-Email option is a great tip for those running a blog. This can be used so that readers have the ability to subscribe to all your latest posts without needing an RSS reader. Even today, lots of people do not use RSS, so using a RSS-to-Email service is crucial. An excellent choice for one is Feedburner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Think of your blog posts as travelers. When you have clicked the publish button, the blog post will continue to survive on its own. Your blog post then becomes a traveler. Try giving your posts what they need to deal with any harsh conditions, along with good instructions on how to prosper online.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Learn everything you can about topics related to your blog. The more quality information you can share, the better your blog will be. The greater your knowledge, the more readers will view you as an expert in the field. This will make the reader more likely to share links to your blog with their contacts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you are attempting to select a topic that will be the basis of your blog, you should make sure that you are interested in your topic. You can’t expect to maintain a blog whose topic doesn’t interest you in anyway. Selecting a topic that you love increases the chance that you’ll stick with continually updating your blog, which will generate new readers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Use a lot of plug-ins on your blog because it gives users the motivation to stick around and explore more of your site. The longer you have someone on your site the more likely they will be to make a purchase. “Most popular posts” and “relevant posts” are just a couple of the most popular plug-ins.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many people overlook the importance of having a keyword rich URL. Having a URL that has keywords related to your article will instantly boost the chances that your site will be seen by someone that is searching the internet on the various search engines. This is a simple step that you can take that will increase your viewership for your blog.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hopefully, you’ve been able to digest what you’ve read here and benefit from it! It’s completely normal if you’re feeling somewhat overwhelmed right now.
