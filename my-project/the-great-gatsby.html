            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The narrator, Nick Carraway, is a young Yale graduate who works as a bond broker in Manhattan. He rents a
                house at West Egg on Long Island across the water from his cousin, Daisy. His neighbour there is the
                enigmatic Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire from the Midwest who lives the high life from the profits
                of his minor criminal activities.</p>
            <p>Gatsby’s infamous parties are attended by many guests who do not know their host. Nick becomes cynically
                fascinated and transfixed by Gatsby, and their friendship nurtures many confidences. Carraway learns
                that Gatsby and Daisy had been in love, but that Daisy had not waited for him to return from the war and
                had married another. Nick arranges a meeting between the two, and Daisy finds herself impressed by the
                change in Gatsby’s fortunes. Daisy’s husband Tom, himself already involved in an affair with the
                garage-owner’s wife Myrtle, becomes jealous of Gatsby’s attentions to his wife. Then Myrtle is killed in
                an accident, and Tom tells Myrtle’s husband that Gatsby is responsible. </p>
            <p>What Mac learns is that there is sixty million American dollars hidden in Cuba by Sara's grandfather when
                he
                fled Castro's revolution. With the "Cuban Thaw" underway between Havana and Washington, Carlos, Eduardo,
                and
                Sara know it's only a matter of time before someone finds the stash - by accident or on purpose. And Mac
                knows if he accepts this job, he'll walk away rich…or not at all. </p>
            <p> Through it all, Nick watches as Gatsby is betrayed by his own dreams, which have been nurtured by a
                meretricious society.</p>

        <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896, in St. Paul, Minnesota. His first novel's success made
            him famous and he married the woman he loved, his muse Zelda, but he later descended into drinking and his
            wife had a mental breakdown. Following the unsuccessful Tender is the Night, Fitzgerald moved to Hollywood
            and became a scriptwriter. He died of a heart attack in 1940, at age 44, his final novel only half
            completed.</p>
        <p>DeMille spent three years at Hofstra University, then joined the Army where he attended Officer Candidate
            School and was commissioned a Lieutenant in the United States Army (1966-69). He saw action in Vietnam
            as an
            infantry platoon leader with the First Cavalry Division and was decorated with the Air Medal, Bronze
            Star,
            and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.</p>
        <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald on September 24, 1896, in St. Paul, Minnesota. His
            namesake (and second cousin three times removed on his father's side) was Francis Scott Key, who wrote the
            lyrics to the "Star-Spangled Banner." Fitzgerald's mother, Mary McQuillan, was from an Irish-Catholic family
            that had made a small fortune in Minnesota as wholesale grocers. His father, Edward Fitzgerald, had opened a
            wicker furniture business in St. Paul, and, when it failed, he took a job as a salesman for Procter & Gamble
            that took his family back and forth between Buffalo and Syracuse in upstate New York during the first decade
            of Fitzgerald's life. However, Edward Fitzgerald lost his job with Procter & Gamble in 1908, when F. Scott
            Fitzgerald was 12, and the family moved back to St. Paul to live off of his mother's inheritance.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald was a bright, handsome and ambitious boy, the pride and joy of his parents and especially his
            mother. He attended the St. Paul Academy, and when he was 13, he saw his first piece of writing appear in
            print: a detective story published in the school newspaper. In 1911, when Fitzgerald was 15 years old, his
            parents sent him to the Newman School, a prestigious Catholic preparatory school in New Jersey. There, he
            met Father Sigourney Fay, who noticed his incipient talent with the written word and encouraged him to
            pursue his literary ambitions.</p>
