            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American black comedy neo-noir crime film written and directed by Quentin
                Tarantino, from a story by Tarantino and Roger Avary.[4] Directed in a highly stylized manner, Pulp
                Fiction connects the intersecting storylines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time
                criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. The film's title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled
                crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy
                dialogue.</p>
            <p>The screenplay of Pulp Fiction was written in 1992 and 1993, and incorporated some scenes originally
                written by Avary for True Romance. Its plot, as in many of Tarantino's other works, is presented out of
                chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title
                card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues
                and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several
                subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. Its script was
                reportedly turned down by Columbia TriStar as "too demented". Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was
                instantly enthralled with it, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.</p>
            <p>Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was a major critical and commercial
                success upon its U.S. release. It was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino and
                Avary won for Best Original Screenplay. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman, each received
                Academy Award nominations for their roles and revitalized and/or elevated their careers. The nature of
                its development, marketing, and distribution — and its consequent profitability — had a sweeping effect
                on the field of independent cinema.</p>

        <p>Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. His father, Tony Tarantino, is an Italian-American
            actor and musician from New York, and his mother, Connie (McHugh), is a nurse from Tennessee. Quentin moved
            with his mother to Torrance, California, when he was four years old.</p>
        <p>In January of 1992, first-time writer-director Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) appeared at the Sundance
            Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years
            later, he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival,
            winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture,
            best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the
            award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Four Rooms
            (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film
            opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was From Dusk Till Dawn
            (1996), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well
            theatrically.</p>
        <p>Since then, Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Jackie Brown
            (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Inglourious Basterds (2009), Django Unchained
            (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015).</p>
