            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Daniel Graham MacCormick - Mac for short - seems to have a pretty good life. At age thirty-five he's
                living
                in Key West, owner of a forty-two-foot charter fishing boat, The Maine. Mac served five years in the
                Army as
                an infantry officer with two tours in Afghanistan. He returned with the Silver Star, two Purple Hearts,
                scars that don't tan, and a boat with a big bank loan. Truth be told, Mac's finances are more than a
                little
                shaky. </p>
            <p>One day, Mac is sitting in the famous Green Parrot Bar in Key West, contemplating his life, and waiting
                for
                Carlos, a hotshot Miami lawyer heavily involved with anti-Castro groups. Carlos wants to hire Mac and
                The
                Maine for a ten-day fishing tournament to Cuba at the standard rate, but Mac suspects there is more to
                this
                and turns it down. The price then goes up to two million dollars, and Mac agrees to hear the deal, and
                meet
                Carlos's clients - a beautiful Cuban-American woman named Sara Ortega, and a mysterious older Cuban
                exile,
                Eduardo Valazquez. </p>
            <p>What Mac learns is that there is sixty million American dollars hidden in Cuba by Sara's grandfather when
                he
                fled Castro's revolution. With the "Cuban Thaw" underway between Havana and Washington, Carlos, Eduardo,
                and
                Sara know it's only a matter of time before someone finds the stash - by accident or on purpose. And Mac
                knows if he accepts this job, he'll walk away rich…or not at all. </p>
            <p>Brilliantly written, with his signature humor, fascinating authenticity from his research trip to Cuba,
                and
                heart-pounding pace, Nelson DeMille is a true master of the genre.</p>
